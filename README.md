# Depolariser

Depolariser is a platform that suggests news articles and sources to promote exposure to opposing viewpoints. Our goal is to create a safe environment that encourages critical thinking and informed discourse by diversifying the news sources consumed by the public.

The website is deployed at [depolariser.herokuapp.com](https://depolariser.herokuapp.com). To learn more about the project, check out our [Learn More](https://depolariser.herokuapp.com/learnmore) page. It was built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The CSS and styling was done completely manually.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once you have Node.js installed, run the following commands in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the server. The website will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

After logging in, you need to navigate to the test page to take the test. The test will ask you to rate your agreement with a series of statements. After completing the test, you will be redirected to the feed page, where you can view articles and sources that are recommended for you. You can also view your results on the top of the page.

You can come back to the feed page at any time to view new articles and sources. You can also take the test again to update your results.
